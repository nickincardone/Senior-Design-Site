        <h2 class="header"> Installing The Database (SQlite) </h2>
        <p>
            In this tutorial, we will be learning how to create a login. In order to do this, we are going to
            establish a database connection. The database we will be using is SQLite, since it is very
            lightweight and works very well with Java.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>First, go to this link and download the latest JAR file. TODO: Add the link for the JAR file</li>
            <li>
                The next step is to install SQLite by downloading the file from here in order to obtain the
                SQLite DB browser, which will allow you to install SQLite. TODO: Add the file from here link
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="divStyle">
        <h2 class="header">Creating A Project</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The next step is to open NetBeans, this is where you will create a new project called <b>ToDoApp</b>.</li>
            <ul class="note"><li>Note that you will choose JavaFX FXML Application from the list of project types.</li></ul>
            <li>Next you will add the JARs to your project by right clicking on Libraries and selecting Add JAR.</li>
            <li>Then navigate to the location of the JAR file you downloaded earlier and select it.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="divStyle">
        <h2 class="header">Setting Up The Database</h2>
        <p>Now let’s setup our database so that we can use it easily</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First, navigate to the project folder of <b>ToDoApp</b> in the command line.</li>
            <li>Then type in <i>sqlite3</i> and press enter.</li>
            <li>You will now see a ‘sqlite>’ pop up in the next line, allowing user input.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This will be the command-line interface through which we will type in SQLite-related commands.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="divStyle">
        <h2 class="header">Creating The Database</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Now, type in <i>.open first.db</i> to create a new DB. </li>
            <ul class="note"><li>Note that you will now see a new file called <b>first</b> in the folder of <b>ToDoApp</b></li></ul>
        </ul>
            <p>
                Now, we can start adding in some data in the database.
                To do this, you can create .sql files which have SQL commands in them, like CREATE TABLE 
                statements, and place these files in the ToDoApp folder. 
                For example, if the .sql file is <b>maketable.sql</b>, then you can execute <i>.read maketable.sql</i> 
                on the command-line. You can also execute simple <i>INSERT</i> or <i>SELECT</i> statements from the 
                command-line, provided the tables you query have been created. Then, the output shows up in 
                the command-line right below the query. 
                We are now ready to integrate the NetBeans project with SQLite.

        <h2 class="header">Changing Between Scenes</h2>
        <p>This section contains information on how to navigate between pages, which will be important in establishing a login.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right-click on the package name in NetBeans, i.e., todoapp, and click on Java -> New Empty FXML and call it <b>FXMLHomePage</b>.</li>
            <li>Then, hit next, check the box ‘Use Java Controller’, and hit next.</li>
            <li>We will not be using CSS for now, so hit finish.</li>
            <li>Following this, right-click on <b>FXMLDocument.fxml</b>, and click on Open.  This will open up a new SceneBuilder window.</li>
            <ul class="note"><li>Note that by default, there will already be a button on the screen!</li></ul>
        </ul>
        <p>We will add a TextField using a simple drag and drop from the left panel under Controls. You could 
            also add a label or two on top, looking like this:</p>
        <p>TODO: Some picture</p>
        <p>Note that the red label at the bottom is only to be displayed if the user enters the incorrect 
           password. Then, we can create the home page, by opening <b>FXMLHomePage.fxml</b> in SceneBuilder. 
           The home page can have a simple layout for now, including just one label displaying the words 
           ‘Home Page’.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="divStyle">
        <h2 class="header">Changing Between Scenes (cont.)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In the file <b>FXMLDocumentController.java</b>, go to the automatically generated method 
                <i>handleButtonAction()</i>, which will correspond to the login button and delete the contents of the method.</li>
            <li>Add a new line <i>Parent home_page_parent 
                = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource(“FXMLHomePage.fxml”);</i>.</li>
            <li>You will need to right click on Parent and click on Fix Imports to make this line work.</li>
            <li>Do this whenever a class you’re using produces an error.</li>
            <ul class="note"><li>Note that there is file I/O involved here, so we will need to append 
                ‘throws IOException’ after <i>void handleButtonAction(ActionEvent event)</i>.</li></ul>
            <li>Then add the line <i>Scene home_page_scene = new Scene(home_page_parent);</i>, this corresponds to SceneBuilder.</li>
            <li>Following this, add the line <i>Stage app_stage = (Stage)((Node) event.getSource().getScene().getWindow());</i>.</li>
            <ul class="note"><li>Note that a stage is the place where everything takes place!</li></ul>
            <li>To check what each method in that line does, just right click on it and view the Javadoc.</li>
            <li>Change the stage to the home page by using the <i>setScene()</i> method.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the end, the <i>handleButtonAction()</i> method will look something like this:</p>
        <p>TODO: Add a picture</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Then, hit the play button and hit the button once the page shows up. It will navigate to the home page screen.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>





    <div class="divStyle">
        <h2 class="header">Verify Login Credentials</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The first thing to do here would be to make sure that there is a table in the SQLite database with some data in it.</li>
            <li>This was covered in the first section of this tutorial, and is done by simple INSERT statements in the appropriate table.</li>
            <li>Once this is done, we can go ahead and write code in the controller classes that we are concerned with.</li>
            <li>Make sure that all the components of the Welcome page, i.e., <b>FXMLDocument.xml</b>, have IDs whose names
                are known, so that they can be accessed in the code. </li>
            <li>The IDs of the components are the means by which we will be able to update the content of these fields.</li>
            <li>The ID can be changed by going to SceneBuilder, clicking on the desired component, and changing its fxid on the right panel, under Code.</li>
            <li>Make sure you hit save in the SceneBuilder window!</li>
            <li>Then, you need to have the tag @FXML, followed by private declarations of each of these components with 
                the variable name corresponding to the FXID, in order to link the components in SceneBuilder to the code.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, the label with fxid ‘invalid_label’ in SceneBuilder is declared as an variable like this: <i>@FXML private Label invalid_label;</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class="divStyle">
        <h2 class="header">Verify Login Credentials (cont.)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a function called <i>isValidCredentials()</i> in the <b>FXMLDocumentController.java</b> file.</li>
            <li>The purpose of this function is to return a true or false depending on whether or not the credentials the user has
                entered exist in the database.</li>
            <li>If they don’t, the error label at the bottom (in red) will be displayed.</li>
            <li>However, if they do, then navigate to the home page using the <i>setScene()</i> and <i>show()</i> methods, as illustrated in 
                the first part of this tutorial.</li>
            <li> In order to clear or edit a TextField in SceneBuilder, simple methods like <i>clear()</i> and <i>setText()</i> can be used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, <i>username_box.clear()</i> will clear the username text field, and <i>invalid_label.setText(“Sorry, invalid credentials!”)</i>
            will render the label for ‘invalid_label’.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="divStyle">
        <h2 class="header">Connecting The Database</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>First, navigate to the <i>isValidCredentials()</i> function you have just created.</li>
            <li>In order to do this, you need a Connection variable and a java.sql.Statement variable.</li>
            <li>Call these ‘conn’ and ‘statement’ respectively, and initialize them both to null.</li>
            <li>‘conn’ is used to connect to the database, and ‘statement’ is used to send SQL statements to it.</li>
            <ul class="note"><li>Note, the code that follows will be enclosed in a try-catch statement to ensure 
                that the forthcoming errors that may pop up are dealt with suitably.</li></ul>
            <li>The first line you write is: <i>conn = DriverManager.getConnection(“jdbc:sqlite:first.db”);</i>.</li>
            <li>Here we are connecting to the database that was created in the first part.</li>
            <li>Then write: <i>conn.setAutoCommit(false);</i></li>
            <li>Next we need to create the statement, so write: <i>statement = conn.createStatement();</i></li>
            <li>We now need to verify the data corresponding to the credentials entered by the user by writing
                the following lines of code: <i>ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery(“SELECT * FROM Users 
                WHERE USERNAME = “ + “‘“ + username_box.getText() + “‘“ + “ AND PASSWORD = “ + “‘“ + 
                password_box.getText() + “‘“);</i> </li>
            <li>This will generate the record corresponding to the entered credentials, and will be stored in the object ‘rs’.</li>
            <li>Then, we can access the data in that object and check whether it is valid.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This code to do this as follow: <br /><br />
            <i>
            boolean let_in = false; <br />
            while(rs.next()) { <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (rs.getString(“USERNAME”) != null && rs.getString(“PASSWORD”) != null) { <br /> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;String username = rs.getString(“USERNAME”); <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(“USERNAME = “ + username); <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;String password = rs.getString(“PASSWORD”); <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(“PASSWORD = “ + password); <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let_in = true; <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br />
            } <br />
            rs.close(); <br /> 
            statement.close(); <br /> 
            c.close();
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the above code, we are first checking whether the result set has any records. 
            We then set the let_in variable to true, indicating that the credentials are valid and we are
            letting the user into the database.
